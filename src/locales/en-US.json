  "about.content": "We don't muck around when it comes to quality at the Beer Labelizer. We print your labels on a HP Latex commercial printer which produces very high quality labels. We then use an HP large format cutter to cut your labels to shape with a precission drag knife plotter. Your labels will look just as good as the labels on beer at the supermarket. They'll be waterproof as well, so no need to worry when throwing your home brew into the cooler. We post our labels anywhere in the world via international air mail. It normally takes up to 4 business days for your labels to arrive if you are in the USA, up to 10 days for elsewhere. Our prices include shipping up front, we don't sting you with unexpected postage fees. Pricing is based on qty, the details are on our pricing page. To order labels, just click on the Buy Stickers button after you design your label",
